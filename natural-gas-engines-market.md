<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External-mix Natural Gas Engine</li><li>Internal-mix Natural Gas Engine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas engines market features two primary types: external-mix and internal-mix engines. External-mix natural gas engines utilize separate pathways for air and gas before mixing them before combustion, allowing for better control over the combustion process and emissions. In contrast, internal-mix engines mix the air and natural gas within the combustion chamber, promoting more efficient combustion but with less control over emissions. Both types cater to different operational needs and applications, influencing market dynamics and technological advancements.</p></p>
