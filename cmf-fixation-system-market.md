<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMF Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMF (Craniofacial and Maxillofacial) fixation system market is classified into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable fixation devices are designed to break down naturally in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal surgeries, which enhances patient comfort. In contrast, non-absorbable fixation devices are made from materials that remain permanently in the body, providing long-lasting stability and support for bone structures. Both types serve critical roles in reconstructive and orthopedic procedures, catering to varying patient needs and surgical requirements.</p></p>
